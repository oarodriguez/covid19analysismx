# Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico

A project to visualize the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico.

## Installation

The project dependencies are managed by [poetry][poetry], so poetry should be
installed in the system. In the project root directory,  execute

```shell
poetry install
```

Poetry will take care of the installation process. Afterward, the project
packages and command-line interface tools should be available in the current
shell. It is recommended to create a separate virtual environment for
this project. If you use [conda][conda], it is enough to make a minimal environment
with Python 3.7 or greater, for instance,

```shell
conda create -n covid19mx python=3.7
```

Naturally, other virtual environment managers can be used.
